## Agenda: Prototypes
1. Objects
2. adding behaviour to objects
3. function to create object
4. Prototype: what and why?
5. Properties around prototype

### - In JavaScript, every object has a prototype object. This object is inherited from the object's constructor function. The prototype object can have properties and methods that are shared by all objects created by the constructor function.
